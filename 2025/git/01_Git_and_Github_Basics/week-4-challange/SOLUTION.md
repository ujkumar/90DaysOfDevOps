# Week 4: Git and GitHub Challenge

Welcome to the Week 4 Challenge! In this task you will practice the essential Git and GitHub commands and concepts taught by Shubham Bhaiya. This includes:

- **Git Basics:** `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`
    - `git init` : Used to initialise git into current working directory.
    - `git add` : Used to add unstaged file from local working directory.
    - `git commit` : Used to add meaning full message for previous staged file.
- **Repository Management:** `git clone`, forking a repository, and understanding how a GitHub repo is made
    - `git clone` : Used to make a clone of remote repository into local work directory.
    - `fork` : In github page we have an option to fork the repository directory to the remote repository.
- **Branching:** Creating branches (`git branch`), switching between branches (`git switch` / `git checkout`), and viewing commit history (`git log`)
    - `Creating branch` : To create a branch we can use `git branch branch_name` it will create an branch named `branch_name`

    - `git switch branch_name` : To switch to an existing branch.
    - `git checkout -b branch_name` : To create a new branch `branch_name` and checkout to `branch_name`.
    - `git log` : Used to check the logs of all commits.
